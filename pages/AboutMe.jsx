            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p className="lead">My name is Scott Saller, and I'm a 24 year old Store Manager from West Chester, Pennsylvania. I first took a fascination with technolology and electronics when I was younger, and always maintained that interest. When I was 15 I learned how to play guitar and joined a band with me and three of my close friends.</p>
